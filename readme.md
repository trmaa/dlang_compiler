# Dlang

Meant to be a modern C succesor:

This is a compiler which parses some syntax to C, and then compiles the C code.

It isn't quite elavorate now, but it can be very much customized.

## Features

Datatypes arn't a thing anymore, now types are the amount of bits they store in stack.

char -> b8,
int -> b32,
float -> b32f,
void -> fn...

In the future, i will add flags and shit...
